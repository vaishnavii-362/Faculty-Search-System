#Problem Statement

During FFCS at VIT, students struggle to manually search for faculty information such as course, slot, rating, and contact details. This leads to confusion and delays during registration.

*Objective*
To develop a simple Python program that allows students to:
-> Search faculty details using keywords
-> Add new faculty entries
-> Access data stored in a separate module (faculty_info.py)
-> Understand basic modular programming concepts

*Scope*
The system includes:
-> Text-based menu
-> Searching through partial phrases
-> Adding new faculty information
-> Storing data in lists/dictionaries
-> No advanced libraries or databases

*Target Users*
The primary users of this system are:
- *VIT Students* preparing for FFCS
- Students who need quick access to:
  - Faculty names  
  - Course codes  
  - Time slots  
  - Class averages or ratings  
  - Email/contact info  

*High-Level Features*
-> Search faculty using partial keywords (name, course, or slot).
-> View faculty details such as course, slot, email, rating, and class average.
-> Add new faculty entries to the system.
-> Simple Python implementation using a separate module (faculty_info.py) to store data.
-> Beginner-friendly, without JSON or databases.


*Methodology*
-> Define the problem
-> Create a separate module (faculty_info.py) for static data
-> Build a menu-driven program
-> Implement search and add functions
-> Allow keyword-based matching
-> Test with multiple inputs

*Expected Outcome*
A working Faculty Search System that:
-> Helps VIT students get required faculty information easily
-> Demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts
-> Runs completely in terminal
-> Is simple, modular, and understandable for beginners
